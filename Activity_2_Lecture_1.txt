Data
Number of XY pairs: 5
Equation: Y = 7.920*X + 0.01280

What does the model achieve?
- Obtains a linear correlation between the Concentration of the solution and Absorbance reading

How should metrics be interpreted?
- the R-square value suggests that the data fit well into a linear correlation with minimal residue

What are appropriate use cases?
-derive a linear correlation between two varibles using a set of collected data

How is it implemented?
-use to predict the value of an unknown variable in case the other variable is known

What are caveats/biases/concerns to its usage?
- need more sample points at different intervals to confirm

How to interpret this specific result and advising action/next step
- The UV/Vis method can be used to measure the concentration of a solution base on the linear correlation between the absorbance reading and solution concentration
